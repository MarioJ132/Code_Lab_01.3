    <string name="article_text"> Doris Miller was working as a mess attendant on the battleship West
        Virginia the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. An alarm
        sounded, and as the ship drew heavy fire, Mr. Miller raced to assist the West Virginia\’s
        fatally wounded commanding officer. He also fired a machine gun against enemy planes. \n
        For his bravery and \“distinguished devotion to duty\” that day, Mr. Miller was awarded the
        prestigious Navy Cross, the second-highest military decoration, in 1942, making him the
        first African-American to receive the medal. \n
        Now, 78 years after the attack, the United States Navy is set to recognize the sailor with
        another honor on Monday, when it is expected to name a CVN-81 aircraft carrier after Mr.
        Miller, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. \n
